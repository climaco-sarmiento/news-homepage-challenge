## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (I'm not focusing on clean code yet)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Initially I tried to solve it with flexbox only. But I soon realized the limitations and learned and implemented Grid. This is my first ever implimentation, although fairly simple.

### Continued development

I have repurposed JavaScript code from W3S. Although I am at 5KYU (JS) at codewars, I still need to learn DOM manipulation. Something I will be focusing in the near future as I will be doing more of these challenges.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Curtain Menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_curtain_menu.asp) - A super helpful resource that I used for the mobile menu.
